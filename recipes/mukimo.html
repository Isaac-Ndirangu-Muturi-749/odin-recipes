    <h2>Mukimo is a dish of a Kenyan origin. It is traditionally served as the main dish of a meal, now in many parts of Africa.</h2>

        The nutritional value of this native dish is very high. Mukimo has been used as an alternative for different side dishes, such as rice, chapati, ugali, and pancakes, all used to accompany the main meal.</p>
    <p>This dish is also cooked relatively quickly, only taking about 45 minutes to make. It also can be stored without going bad, making it perfect for leftovers.</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>Irish potatoes</li>
        <li>Corn kernels</li>
        <li>Beans or peas of choice</li>
        <li>Pumpkin leaves</li>
        <li>Tablespoon of salt</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol><li>Peel the potatoes and rinse them. Keep them in a bowl, covered with clean water.</li>
<li>Shell the corn and remove the grains from the cobs. This is to ensure that it is easier to boil them.</li>
<li>Mix the corn kernels with beans or peas, based on what you have available. The result of this mixture is termed as “githeri”. It is the signature ingredient in the making of mukimo.</li>
<li>Boil the githeri till all the constituents are well cooked.</li>
<li>When the githeri is ready, drain the remaining water and place the mixture into a separate bowl.</li>
<li>Boil the potatoes, adding some salt to ensure that the potatoes are tasty. When they are well cooked, soft when stuck with a fork, drain the remaining water and place the potatoes in a separate bowl.</li>
<li>Chop the greens you’ve chosen into thick slices on a chopping board. Boil them until they are soft, only for a few minutes (depends on the type of green used). This ensures that the greens soften and makes it possible to produce the green color easily.
</li>
<li>Lightly blend the boiled leaves to ensure that they will be easily distributed when it is time to use them in the preparation.</li>
<li>Mash the boiled potatoes until every bit of the potatoes is well mashed.</li>
<li>Add the githeri to the already mashed potatoes, and ensure they are well mixed to create a uniformly formed solid mass. Add salt to taste.</li>
<li>Place the blended leaves into the bowl containing the mixture, and mix them gently and uniformly to give the dish its signature green color.</li>
<li>Add a teaspoon or so of cooking oil to a heated skillet. On medium-low heat, sauté the onions until they are translucent.</li>
<li>Stir the mukimo into the sautéed onions and oil until they are fully incorporated. Your mukimo is now ready to serve!
</li>
    </ol>
